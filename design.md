# Hearts
About hearts.
About courage.
About relationships.

## Behavior, or: Courage & Relationships
Characters have 

Concerns that alter their Conduct that alters Conditions that alter their Concerns

This is also known as the Observe Orient Decide Act loop.

Everything feeds back into Observations,
which feeds forward into Orientation, the overarching pattern of the person,
which feeds forward into Decision, a current plan of action,
which feeds forward into Action.

Periodically characters reassess things, so the feedback loop is not immediate,
and they will reassess immediate circumstances more often than they will
reassess large operational strategies.

This creates momentum between Concerns -> Conduct -> Conditions -> Concerns,
that is, characters will update slower than circumstances actually change,
which allows them to have followthrough and pursue things "courageously"
even in the face of unlikely odds (that is, they don't update to "retreat"),
without being absolutely morons (that is, they can commit to "pursue this for
a while and then try something else").

# Setup
7 dungeon levels where you command a small party of warriors/adventurers.

This revolves around starting with at least 1 companion and maybe you could
acquire more if it was a full game but this is 7 days of dev, so maybe not.

I think my game makes most sense atm if I, in defiance of the grand tradition
of roguelikes going deeper and deeper into a pit, I have the player work up.

so you arrive at a fortress
you get to circle it and case it, giving you an idea of the outmost limits.
and so areas that are outside of concern are clearly marked.
this will give you an idea of how the rest of the game plays out.

You probably get to pick a few party members, as opposed to picking your
character's class, since your class is in all cases "Strategos" or smth.

Setup:
you're leading a charge into a sapped tunnel, you emerge in the basement
and work your way up.
all units inside are busy looking outwards or marshaling to the walls, so
they're not bothering with you immediately.
the goal is to reach the top and take out the cannons, so the 7th floor has
a mostly predetermined premise.

try to make options and choices in exploration
try to avoid having it turn into one big battle
let the player pick apart the fortress even if that feels illogical.
enemies have no drops they don't use, and mostly nonrandom gear

periodic reinforcements might arrive for both sides.
spawn chests of loot, etc. at level procgen.
this prevents players from feeling like they have to grind reinforcements.
levels are persistent.
7 floors
basement, walls, courtyard, penetrating multiple bastions?
